        <div class="ed">Raksha Bandhan is the unending bond of love and cares among sisters and brothers. According to Hindu mythological facts:

            once Lord Krishna got a cut in his finger by his Sudarshan Chakra, then Princess Draupadi tied a knot on his cut from the border of her Saree as a cure. Lord Krishna then promised her to protect her from every harsh scenario; she will face in the future. In Bhavishya Purana this knot was considered as the origin of the custom of Rakhi.
            
            Some other religious facts say that Goddess Lakshmi once sent a thread to ruler Bali for reliving her companion (Lord Vishnu). After receiving the thread Bali felt that he is liable to the goddess and he asked Lord Vishnu for returning to Vaikuntha.
            
            Commercial Perspective of the Fest: For celebrating the auspicious occasion of Raksha Bandhan, various fancy Rakhis are sold each year. Rakhi stalls are decorated by providing various options for buyers. The E-Commerce market also makes a good business during the season of Rakhi.

         <p>The word ‘Raksha Bandhan’ has a very significant meaning. Raksha means protection and Bandhan means bond. It is the celebration of a chaste bond of love and protection between a Brother and Sister. This Festival symbolizes love and harmony. This occasion comes in August. As per the Hindu calendar, it is celebrated on a full moon day. Typically, this Festival is celebrated by people hailing from the northern and western part of India. This occasion is also called by different names in different parts of the country. Some people call this Festival ‘Rakhi Purnima’, some call it ‘Kajri Purnima’.  In many states, this Festival is considered as an important day for farmers and women who have sons. On this occasion, people worship Lord Shiva. As per the tradition, the Sisters prepare a thali or a plate with diya, roli, rice and Rakhis. First, she offers prayers to God and then ties Rakhi to the Brothers and wishes for their well-being. The Brother in turn acknowledges the love with a Promise to be by the Sisters’ side always and gives her a Gift as a token of love. </p>
